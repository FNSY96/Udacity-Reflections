When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I need to access my data from another computer or when I work on a
    project with another developers who need to push and pull files on the
    same repo.
    Also, it is useful to backup the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This might be useful in certain cases, for example: if I was working on a
    project with other developers, any unexpected pull request may affect the
    code I'm working on at that moment.

1. git credential-osxkeychain
    // to test if osxkeychain helper is installed on the device
2. git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
    // to enable the auto completion for passwords on macOS through keychain
    (password caching)
3. git remote (with no args)
    // shows the remotes I am having on a certain repo
4. git remote add "name" link
    // creates a new name (refers to the repo specified in the link)
5. git remote -v (verbose)
    // returns detailed info about the remote
6. git push "remote name" "branch name"
    // will push the branch to the remote repo with its name (branch's name)
7. git pull "remote name" "branch name"
    // pulls any new commits on the branch to the local device
